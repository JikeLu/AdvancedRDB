REM This file is part of the server triggers lab. 
REM This file is used to insert data into the repairs table
REM It tests trigger reward_best_mechanic
REM in file serv_trig3.txt. We insert 2 mechanics with REM equal salaries, and increase the number of repair REM jobs of Thomas Smith to >10. This should cause his salary 
REM to go up to the maximum allowed, which is 60,000
REM in this case.
